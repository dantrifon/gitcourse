Git is primarily designed for managing text-based files, such as source code, documentation, and configuration files. However, it is possible to use Git for binary files, such as images, videos, and binary executables. Here are some tips for using Git with binary files:

    Use Git LFS: Git LFS (Large File Storage) is an extension for Git that allows you to store large files outside of your Git repository, while still tracking their versions in Git. When you commit a large file to Git LFS, it stores a pointer to the file in Git, rather than the file itself. This makes it more efficient to work with large files in Git, since you don't have to transfer the entire file every time you push or pull changes. Git LFS is supported by many popular Git hosting services, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

    Be mindful of file size: Git is not well-suited for handling very large files, especially if you are working with a distributed team. Large files can slow down Git operations, increase the size of your Git repository, and make it harder to collaborate effectively. As a rule of thumb, try to keep binary files smaller than a few hundred megabytes, if possible. If you need to work with larger files, consider using Git LFS or another file storage solution.

    Use a Gitignore file: Gitignore is a file that tells Git which files to ignore when committing changes. You can use a Gitignore file to exclude binary files from your Git repository, which can help to reduce the size of your repository and make it faster to work with. For example, you can add lines like *.mp4 or *.png to your Gitignore file to exclude all MP4 videos or PNG images from your Git repository.

    Consider using Git annex or other Git extensions: Git annex is a Git extension that allows you to store large files outside of your Git repository, similar to Git LFS. However, Git annex is more flexible and can handle a wider variety of storage backends, such as cloud storage providers, external hard drives, or network-attached storage. Other Git extensions, such as Git media or Git fat, provide similar functionality to Git annex.

    Be careful when merging binary files: Unlike text files, binary files cannot be merged automatically by Git. If you have multiple people working on the same binary file, you may run into conflicts when trying to merge their changes together. To avoid conflicts, try to minimize the number of people working on binary files simultaneously, and communicate with your team to coordinate changes effectively.
